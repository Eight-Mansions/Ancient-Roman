Ancient Roman - Power of Dark Side: English Patch (July 2024)
#############################################################

## Intro ##
The legendary kusoge—the Final Fantasy 7 killer—now arrives in English
for the first time!

Join Kai, a tragic prince who was kidnapped as a baby and forced to work
for demons as they sought ancient evil power that lived underground. Meet
various allies to rid the world of darkness once and for all, one (broken
music, laggy sound, and nonsense plot) step at a time!

## Patch Instructions ##
* The patcher expects the BIN version of both discs*

### Windows ###
1. Select any number of .bin files you wish to patch.
2. Drag and drop them on the file called "Drag and drop BIN(s) on me.bat"
3. If a valid disc image is found, patched .bin/.cue files will be created
   in this folder.

### Other OS ###
This release uses a basic .xdelta patch, so any web-based patching tool or
OS-specific .xdelta patcher should work okay. We've switched from xdelta3
to xdelta to help with compatability. The .xdelta files are located in the
"patch_data" folder. Apply the appropriate patch to each disc.

## Guide and Item/Spell Tables ##
PLAYTESTERS! I will be including finished guides here and on gamefaqs, but
for now, I'd like to have them editable on my wiki for any contributions
or fixes you find along the way.

## FAQ ##
- The music sounds broken, is my emulator—
No, that's intentional. The MIDI music in this game mismatches instruments
and throws the music key off constantly, ranging from normalish songs to
what it would sound like to live in a claw machine.

- Why do the sound effects freeze the whole game?
Every sound effect is normalized to 10 full seconds, meaning it has to transfer
it off disc, into RAM, play it, then boot it out every time. No we will not
fix this.

- Will you translate the drama CD?
I'll think about it.

- Why People Becoming Monsters Disease?
I could have gone for something like Monsterfication Disease, but that would
make more sense if they did 怪物化病気, but they went with 怪物になる病気,
which is lit "disease that makes you into a monster," so I'm just being more
accurate to their really wordy name. Also it's funny.

## Tips ##
- Once you're given weapons and armor at the beginning, make sure to equip them!
- When you reach Sanitas Village, make sure to examine the hot springs before
  going to bed so you don't miss the *mushroom scene*.
- The famous speedrun trick in this game is using the "Sleep Axe," an incredibly
  broken weapon for Burke that, on hit, will put the enemy to sleep 100% of the
  time, even bosses. It's so broken, any boss that's a singular enemy can never
  wake up. I only recommend using it if you're stuck or just want to see the
  story, as it makes the game trivial and you miss out on a lot of the spells
  and challenges.
- Don't abuse this, but you can actually just, like, not encounter enemies if
  you hold O. Yeah. Don't get too underleveled because of it!
- Speed Cocca raises your ability to act first, meaning you can Sleep Axe faster.
- Talk to the chickens in Heinrogue.
- Many side content triggers are really confusing, involving random backtracking
  or only coming back to places at certain times. For instance, you can only
  access the door in the back of the digging camp while McLeod is with you,
  since only he can figure out that door. I tried to outline as many as I could
  find in the guide.
