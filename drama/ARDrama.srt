1
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,660
Our story begins in a land far away, in a time known to none, in a place known to none.

2
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,060
There once was a young king who ruled the kingdom of Heinrogue.

3
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,030
Who goes there!?

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,380
It's me.

5
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,330
Forgive my rudeness, your highness.

6
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,670
You're the knight captain?

7
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,900
Yes, Captain Jenatos, sir.

8
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
Did you think me an enemy?

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,640
Only the spirits of the night visit the ramparts at this hour,

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,880
let alone the king himself.

11
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,490
I apologize for startling you then.

12
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,330
You did nothing wrong.

13
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,970
Jenatos, please tell me something.

14
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,650
Why is spring so late to come this year?

15
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,210
It is strange... It's been far more cold than normal.

16
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,100
May is supposed to begin tomorrow.

17
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,940
Right, I suppose it is the end of April.

18
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,640
The fields are still white with frost, keeping the plants from budding.

19
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,600
The world should be bathed in the color of vibrant flowers, but not one is to be seen...

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,200
Sometimes that's just how nature is...

21
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,510
Nothing good has happened since my father died and I took the throne.

22
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,040
That's... You're worrying too much, your highness.

23
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,840
Famine. Plague. War. Am I just too weak?

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,190
Is the kingdom doomed to suffer at the hands of a novice king in their twenties?

25
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,970
What are you saying, your highness!?

26
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,680
The country needs its king the most when times are tough.

27
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,980
What could I even do?

28
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,010
I'm powerless to help the kingdom.

29
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,210
I wish I had strength.

30
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,430
I wish I had knowledge...

31
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:49,380
Ravens again... They've been increasing, haven't they?

32
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,720
Probably... since there's been more deaths lately...

33
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:03,830
Ten... Twenty... Where are they headed?

34
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,070
Probably to the barren mountains.

35
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,830
...you said you desired power, did you not?

36
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,790
Yeah. I suppose I did.

37
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:26,750
What must a monarch have to turn an ashen country into a prosperous one?

38
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,970
As I've said, the king's abilities affect the kingdom.

39
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,940
That is not all.

40
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,580
Go on...

41
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:42,620
Every man needs a source of power. A king is no exception.

42
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,930
You mean...

43
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,950
Powerful kings of yore had powerful benefactors.

44
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,110
Benefactors?

45
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,220
I'm sure you know of the stone ruins on top of that barren mountain.

46
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,040
Of course, the temple that once laid there.

47
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,380
When night comes again, head there.

48
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,870
Your wishes will surely be granted.

49
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,400
What do you mean, Jenatos!?

50
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,520
You'll have to find out on your own. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to patrol.

51
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,910
Allow me to read tomorrow's schedule, your highness.

52
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,830
Go ahead.

53
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,570
In the morning, an ambassador from our neighbor wishes to meet with you.

54
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,240
Would you like a private reception room? Or in the public hall?

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,270
Either.

56
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,220
Private room, it is. Next, the mayor of Rune Malna wishes to see you.

57
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,200
Ah.

58
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,960
Are you listening, your highness?

59
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,740
I'm listening. What does he want?

60
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,170
It seems to be about the worsening food supplies.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,770
Not like my words will fix anything...

62
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,880
After lunch, you—

63
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,980
That's enough.

64
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,530
But, your highness—

65
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,950
Leave the schedule there. I'll make sure to read it.

66
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,470
Understood. Good night then, your highness.

67
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,470
You too.

68
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,430
Dear.

69
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,350
Marina...

70
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,900
You seem dreadfully tired...

71
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,620
It's nothing.

72
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,120
You should get to bed right away.

73
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,500
There's somewhere I have to go tonight.

74
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,680
At this hour? Where to?

75
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,300
I'll be back before you know it. Please don't wait up for me, okay?

76
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,030
It's an important time to take care of your body, so please rest.

77
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,510
If you insist...

78
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,060
Hello, my lady. Is the king not coming to bed yet?

79
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,560
N-no... Something seems to have come up.

80
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,160
In that case, let's lower your hair and get you ready for bed.

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Thanks, Julia.

82
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,960
I'm so jealous of your beautiful long, blonde hair~

83
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,930
Your chestnut-brown hair is lovely too, Julia.

84
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,230
Thanks!

85
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,120
But wow, the king is really cool yet gentle, isn't he?

86
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,920
...I hope Lewis comes back soon.

87
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,040
What's this light?

88
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,260
Good evening! Where you off to at this hour?

89
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,930
And you are?

90
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,370
Fara! And you?

91
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,670
King Lewis.

92
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,080
Ahh! You're a human king!

93
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,650
Hmm, but wasn't the king, uh, Rudolph or something?

94
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,910
That was my great-grandfather.

95
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,160
Oh right, I forget that humans don't live all that long.

96
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,380
Are you a fairy?

97
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,380
Pixie.

98
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,980
Pixie?

99
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:39,230
Hey, Lewis, this might be rude of me, but you shouldn't go any further this way.

100
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,470
Why not?

101
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,080
It seems a bunch of monsters are gathering on the mountain.

102
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,210
What!?

103
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,720
Well then, I'm off! In a bit of a hurry myself.

104
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,620
What was I in a hurry for again...?

105
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,750
What the...? Why did Jenatos tell me to come to a gathering of ghouls and goblins...?

106
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
Ah!

107
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,120
You kept us waiting.

108
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:32,260
Our special guest has arrived, but he seems to be hiding! Hehehehe...

109
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,570
There! You must be Heinrogue's king, right?

110
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,020
Y-yes.

111
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,270
You're not the first I've seen. You wish for power, do you not?

112
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,660
Who are you?

113
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,420
I'm asking if you wish for power, riches, and wisdom!?

114
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,660
Yes...!

115
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,880
Good...

116
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:09,870
I shall make you the richest, wisest, and most powerful of kings. Now, stick out your hand.

117
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,070
Ah!

118
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:18,360
All you must do is accept this ring, and your wishes shall be granted.

119
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,180
-Um—
-Now, put on the ring!

120
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,720
Or what, are you afraid?

121
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,640
No...

122
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,710
Perfect. Now, your dreams will now become your reality.

123
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:52,440
In return... Once the time is right, your most precious thing will become mine.

124
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,770
!!

125
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,190
Hahahahahaha...

126
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:05,180
You've just entered a blood pact with me, Gizafeal!

127
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,540
HAHAHAHAHA!

128
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,180
AHHHH!!!

129
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:40,860
A few months passed since then. As promised, King Lewis's luck turned around,

130
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,010
and the country seemed on the road to recovery.

131
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,330
However...

132
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,330
You called for me?

133
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,380
Ah, minister! I've been waiting. I seek your counsel about our current lands.

134
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,720
Alright...

135
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,750
Look at this map. If we wish to extend the highway to Nautilus, we'll have to cut through the Pixian Forest.

136
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,930
While we're there, why don't we just clear the whole forest and turn it into farmland?

137
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,380
But sir, that's there the pixies and elves live—

138
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,680
What can we do? A prosperous nation needs a powerful economy and military.

139
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,650
We can have all of that with this highway.

140
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,500
But—

141
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,450
How much manpower would this take, minister?

142
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,350
My liege, I'm sure you're very much aware,

143
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:42,560
but the people are exhausted from repeated war and hardships. Any more would be—

144
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,680
It's for the nation! If it falls, the people fall with it.

145
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,890
But...!

146
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:58,170
Haven't my policies led to our victory at war and the rapid growth of our economy?

147
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,340
Are you saying I'm wrong?

148
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,700
Your happiness does not equal the people's happiness!

149
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,780
Please think of those who lost loved ones to war, or those struggling under heavy taxes!

150
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,580
Aren't my people just that? MY people?

151
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,020
Your highness! Please refrain from speaking like that!!

152
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,490
-You'll turn the people against—
-That's enough!

153
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,470
It was a waste of time talking to my foolish minister.

154
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,080
-Rethink this.
-Stand down.

155
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,030
My lady, it's time to prepare for the banquet.

156
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,440
Another banquet... Luxurious banquets nearly every night can't possibly be a good thing.

157
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,810
Come on, don't say that.

158
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:54,510
These beautiful clothes and delicacies are being paid for by the people's taxes!

159
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,410
The king will be upset if you don't show up in your finest.

160
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:08,780
Lewis has really changed... This jewel he gave me was something plundered from our neighboring country!

161
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,300
I can feel the blood on it...

162
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,780
Please, try not to see only the bad in everything.

163
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,170
Let me open the window so we can relax with some fresh air.

164
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,960
What?

165
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,900
Are you the queen?

166
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,920
Huh? A pixie?

167
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,170
Yup, my name's Fara.

168
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,660
Why are you here?

169
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,640
The forest where we all live is being chopped down. Please, do something!

170
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,940
What? The Pixian Forest?

171
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,810
Yes! Another section was just leveled today!

172
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,840
...I had no idea...

173
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,520
The king's just said progress is going smoothly.

174
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,700
Destroying the forest is "progress"!?

175
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,080
That's not what—

176
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,290
I'll try talking with the king. Though, I don't know if he'll listen...

177
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,230
The lush forests don't belong to just one group!

178
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:10,010
Even humans will fall to ruin if they keep cutting down the trees! Make sure the king knows that!!

179
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,090
Jenatos.

180
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,820
Lord Gizafeal...

181
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,680
Rejoice, for the fruit has ripened.

182
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,060
W-what do you mean?

183
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,670
You must be tired of standing watch on these cold walls.

184
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,890
Right...

185
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,450
You're the knight captain, yet you're treated like dirt.

186
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:53,470
Meanwhile, the royal family sleeps warm and cozy in the luxury of the castle.

187
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,730
Yeah...

188
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:01,050
Was it not the soldiers who won the war?

189
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,550
Are you not frustrated?

190
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,840
A... a little...

191
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,510
They're currently indulging in the finest of liquor.

192
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,800
Don't worry, the people will rally behind you.

193
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,320
Kill King Lewis.

194
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,080
Then become the king yourself!

195
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,880
Ah...

196
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,000
Dear, I wish to ask you about the Pixian Forest.

197
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,930
Ahh, the forest we're building the highway through. With that road built, access to the harbor will be much easier.

198
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,470
Please, don't—

199
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:46,100
Not just the road either! With all that lumber, we can craft ships and use the cleared land for crops.

200
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,910
Oh, we should build a workshop there too to make weapons, and—

201
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,880
Please, reconsider this plan!

202
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,400
That's the home of the pixies and the elves!

203
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:05,050
That forest... No, all the forests, mountains, and rivers all belong to me!

204
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:12,350
Hmm, I wonder if the pixies or the elves could be put to work for the benefit of the country...

205
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,650
That's—

206
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,910
Just leave all the political matters to me, okay?

207
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:24,090
Just relax and enjoy being adorned in the finest clothes and gems the world has to offer!

208
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:28,970
I do not enjoy that at all...

209
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,590
Marina...

210
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,670
Your highness! The knight captain has urgent business to report.

211
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:41,380
What a boorish man, interrupting this gathering. Oh well, let him in.

212
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,230
What's the emergency, Jenatos?

213
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,470
Your highness. Your crown seems to have lost some of its luster.

214
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,850
...what are you talking about?

215
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:04,280
It must feel good gazing down upon the world from your lofty throne.

216
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,480
Jenatos?

217
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,580
Ash has sullied the shine from your crown.

218
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Let me clean it by taking your life!!

219
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
What are you doing!?

220
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,180
Stop! Lower your sword at once, Jenatos!!

221
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,150
I'LL HACK AWAY THE ASH FROM THE CROWN!!!

222
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,420
GUARDS! GUARDS!!!

223
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,600
SEIZE HIM!

224
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,440
LET ME GO! I HAVE TO CLEAR THE ASH!!!

225
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,160
OVERWHELM HIM AND TAKE HIM AWAY!!!

226
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,130
UNHAND ME!!! I'M THE RIGHTFUL KING!!!

227
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:57,990
REMEMBER, YOU'RE IN THE PALM OF GIZAFEAL'S HAND! HE'LL BE COMING FOR YOU NEXT!!!

228
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,590
Are you hurt, your highness!?

229
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,920
I-I'm fine...

230
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,330
What happened to Jenatos!?

231
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:16,620
I don't know, but he won't see the light of day again after that.

232
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,680
How dreadful. His wife even has a child on the way...

233
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,680
They'll grow up knowing they had a worthless father.

234
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,940
Who is that Gizafeal that Jenatos mentioned?

235
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,250
It's nothing. Just the vile rubbish of a man lost in his own darkness.

236
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,230
What are you doing sulking in a place like this, dear?

237
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,110
Does what happened with Jenatos still bother you?

238
00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:03,920
That's not it... Say, Marina. What would you say my most precious thing in the world is?

239
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,950
How could I possibly know that better than yourself?

240
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:14,430
Fair. In that case, what's the most important thing to you?

241
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:20,830
I have many things. You, my dear. My own life, perhaps.

242
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:28,060
Maybe it'll be our child when they're born. My parents are precious to me too.

243
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,500
I see. All things you can't purchase with wealth, huh.

244
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:41,580
Of course. You couldn't obtain any of those things with power alone, perhaps not even with wisdom.

245
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,260
What is it, dear?

246
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,410
Marina. I'm... thinking of traveling to Hermit's Island.

247
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,900
Hermit's Island? What for?

248
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:04,120
They say a skilled diviner lives there. I wish to seek his advice.

249
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,890
Well, he should live inside that cave over there, but—

250
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:23,080
Got it. I'll be heading there alone. You can return to the ship, minister.

251
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,600
Alright... Be careful.

252
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,260
Bats!?

253
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,430
I've been waiting for you.

254
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,340
You wished to hear of your future self, did you not?

255
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,980
You knew I was coming?

256
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:56,760
The holy mirror here always reflects what it needs to.

257
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,510
Is it true you can read the future?

258
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:10,030
Do you wish to find out? But please remember; the future may not hold the happiness you seek.

259
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,920
All people will die one day. That won't phase me.

260
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,800
I speak of the method of your death, not the death itself.

261
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,010
I fear nothing. Let me hear it.

262
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,990
Then, give me your hand. ...oh my.

263
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,840
What?

264
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:35,070
You bear a burdensome ring. It would best be parted with.

265
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:44,160
I... can't remove it. It's like it has become one with my flesh.

266
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,340
I see.

267
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,630
Do you know what this ring is?

268
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,330
No, I... I'm making too much of it.

269
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,660
Now, place your hands upon the mirror's pedestal.

270
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,920
-Like this?
-Yes.

271
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,150
Now, the time spirits will bubble forth from the mirror's depths.

272
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,940
What do you see?

273
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,210
I see treasure. The king and the queen. And...

274
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,470
And?

275
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,200
A young child, just born.

276
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,030
Are they a boy? A girl?

277
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:33,130
I can't see yet. I see them crawling around. Ah, they're a healthy boy!

278
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,490
I see, a boy!

279
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:44,190
He grows up into a fine lad, no, a splendid man. ...oh no.

280
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,380
W-what?

281
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
He...

282
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,940
That's it. The mirror has clouded over.

283
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,420
What happened? What happens to me in the end!?

284
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,680
...you would be better off not knowing.

285
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,750
Do I die of disease? In battle?

286
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,330
Much worse...

287
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,200
I grow tired of this! Just tell me already!!

288
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,780
You fall to the ground... at the hands of your own son.

289
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,800
My son... kills me? Are you sure?

290
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,110
I'm afraid so.

291
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,120
This mirror must be spitting lies!

292
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,360
It is possible, I suppose. Though it has never lied before now.

293
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,100
Is there no changing it? My destiny?

294
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,010
I... do not know of such a way.

295
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,090
How could this be...?

296
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,890
With a heavy heart, the king returned to Heinrogue.

297
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:11,960
The terrible prophecy from the diviner repeated in his head over and over.

298
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,560
You fall to the ground... at the hands of your own son.

299
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,600
What troubles you, my lord?

300
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,730
It's nothing.

301
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,090
Did you learn anything from the diviner?

302
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,580
Nothing important.

303
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,800
Whatever you heard, don't let it bother you.

304
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I know...

305
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,580
Do you think he'll be back tonight, Julia?

306
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:53,160
I'm sure he will be. We received early word from a messenger about his imminent arrival.

307
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,030
Thank goodness... Oh!

308
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,580
What's wrong?

309
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,010
The baby kicked!

310
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:05,930
Let me see... Oh, there it is! It really won't be much longer now!

311
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:11,050
Oh, I'm so excited! Will it be a boy? Or a girl?

312
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,370
I can't wait! I'm sure the king will be excited as well!

313
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,800
Definitely! Ahh, I don't want to wait any longer!

314
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,560
The king has arrived!

315
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,890
See, he's here!

316
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:34,540
Julia, what do you make of those two stars near the horizon?

317
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,910
Hmm... I can't say I've seen those stars before.

318
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,730
It's like they're twins nestling close to each other.

319
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,210
They are twin stars, after all, my lady.

320
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,330
Marina!

321
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,020
Dear!

322
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,150
I'm home.

323
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,850
Welcome home, your highness.

324
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,440
Thanks and good work, Julia.

325
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,140
How were your travels?

326
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,440
Peaceful and uneventful, couldn't have been better.

327
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,290
That's wonderful! So your task at Hermit's Island is finished?

328
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,400
Hmm? A-ahh...

329
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,180
I'll have to hear all about it later.

330
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:22,350
No, it really wasn't worth talking about. It was a waste of effort, going that far.

331
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,400
That's too bad...

332
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,310
How are you feeling, Marina?

333
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,840
Oh, very well!

334
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,150
Your highness, the child inside of her kicked just a minute ago!

335
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,790
I-I see.

336
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,460
They're a very lively child. If it's a boy, he'll become a strong—

337
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,390
Sorry, I wish to sleep early tonight. Has the bed been prepared?

338
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,820
Yes...

339
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,170
Dear...

340
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:02,460
Not long after, the queen gave birth to a healthy boy.

341
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,000
Announcing the crown prince!!

342
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:29,880
Mysteriously, another child was born at the same hour in a house close to the castle.

343
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,960
I've brought dinner, my lady.

344
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,250
I don't have an appetite.

345
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:55,600
You need to eat something! We'll get you back to health soon to match the lively child you made.

346
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,500
Mhmm. At this rate, however, I'll have to miss out on the naming ceremony.

347
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,830
I see. Oh, I heard an interesting rumor recently.

348
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:15,880
Another child was born at the same time as the crown prince. Any guesses as to whom?

349
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,350
Who could it be...?

350
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,770
It was Jenatos' child.

351
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,040
Jenatos'?

352
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,430
It's a girl they named Sarina.

353
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:38,190
Sarina... It must be hard on the mother raising her alone after what her father did...

354
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,920
Yes. It sounds like they're worried about how to raise Sarina alone.

355
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,300
I'd imagine...

356
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,570
Do you think the king might be convinced to pardon him?

357
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,410
Not likely. Insurrection is a terrible crime.

358
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,310
I suppose it is...

359
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,470
Julia, would you mind opening the window? I'd love some fresh air.

360
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,250
Of course.

361
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:21,180
Ah, fall has clearly arrived. Another week, and the leaves will start falling.

362
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,840
Mhmm. Oh, those twin stars seem to have disappeared.

363
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:41,370
They were so bright even. It's almost as if the two stars themselves fell down and became your child and Sarina.

364
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,700
It seems like that... It really does...

365
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:57,370
This child is meant to kill me?

366
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,370
That's just...

367
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:07,200
If I just twist his neck... he'd die right here.

368
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,610
If I simply drop him from this window...

369
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,600
...would my fate change?

370
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,590
There, there. Forgive me. This will all be over soon.

371
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,010
What are you doing, king!? Stop it! Stop it!!

372
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,690
When did a pixie get here!?

373
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,350
My name's Fara, remember it this time!

374
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,160
Don't get in my way!

375
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,850
What were you doing with the child? You weren't going to throw him out the window, were you!?

376
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,850
N-no...

377
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:55,050
I don't know what's going on, but it's never okay to raise your hand against a defenseless child!

378
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:04,540
And isn't this your kid? You're not having an affair with your wife, are you?

379
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,760
Quiet you. How could you say that!?

380
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,280
Haha, sorry, sorry~ Let's just take a step back, okay?

381
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
This child will one day—

382
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,270
What a healthy boy! He'll be quite the rascal when he's older.

383
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:27,740
What did I come here for again... Oh right! I came here to say goodbye.

384
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,560
Goodbye?

385
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:38,560
The forest we live in is gone now. The pixies and the elves have all left you.

386
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:46,410
Many went to neighboring countries, others underground. I'm about to leave myself.

387
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,350
You won't be back?

388
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:59,440
Who knows? But king, try not to make any more mistakes, okay? For both the country and yourself.

389
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,890
And also, try to remember.

390
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,640
Remember what?

391
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,960
Drawing water with a clean bucket leaves the well clean, but a filthy bucket will poison the well forever. Bye now!

392
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,960
Ah...

393
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,240
Your highness?

394
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,110
Ah, Julia.

395
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,990
The minister wishes to go over tomorrow's naming ceremony with you.

396
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,820
Ah, got it...

397
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:32,240
Aww, aren't you glad your father held you up, you little prince~

398
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,790
He's in quite the good mood, isn't he?

399
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,110
He must love his father.

400
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,030
Your highness, I'll—

401
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:57,850
He really does look more and more like you by the day~ Maybe he'll grow larger and gaze down upon you!

402
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,240
A-ah...

403
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,770
I'm looking forward to the ceremony tomorrow, your highness.

404
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,460
What kind of a name do you think the Six Gods will bestow upon him?

405
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,390
Who knows.

406
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:16,120
He was born under the dragon, so I'm sure the Dragon God's disciple will give him a fine name.

407
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,510
Your highness! There you are!

408
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,360
Minister?

409
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,820
I'm being dragged around left and right!

410
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,660
I'm being asked about seating for tomorrow, and now the guests are starting to quarrel with each other! I can't keep up!

411
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,990
I got it, I'll be there shortly.

412
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,460
Well then, how does this sound for the seating of the visiting countries?

413
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
Good, no problems here.

414
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:49,740
Next for the non-humans guests. I'm not sure why, but there's been no response from the elves or the pixies.

415
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,960
They refused the invitation?

416
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,680
No... They seem to have disappeared.

417
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,560
Pay it no mind. It's no great loss.

418
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,440
But the ceremony where the elves and pixies of the kingdom come here has meaning and—

419
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,180
How can we invite who is not there?

420
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:18,960
On another note, there are rumors of goblins and hobgoblins growing in numbers throughout the kingdom.

421
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,480
We'll pick that topic up another time. Continue.

422
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,430
The disciples of the Six Gods have accepted the invites.

423
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:34,250
That is to say, the Ocean God, the Mountain God, the Hero God, the Fertility Goddess, the Spirit God, and the Dragon God.

424
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,160
I see.

425
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,950
With them here, I'm sure the naming ceremony will go smoothly.

426
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,930
Then there's no problem, right?

427
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:51,840
One more thing: as the royal family, you may decide if you wish to extend an invite to the Seventh God.

428
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,730
Seventh God?

429
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,530
The one who rules the Underworld, Gizafeal.

430
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,970
What's wrong, your highness?

431
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,040
Gizafeal is the one who rules over death?

432
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,150
That is correct.

433
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,100
He's... There's no need to invite someone like that to the naming ceremony.

434
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,030
Understood.

435
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,920
Have any of my ancestors ever invited him in the past?

436
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,170
Nothing I've seen in our records going back several hundred years, but in older times—

437
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,260
Why!?

438
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:30,250
Gizafeal, while ruling over the dead, also rules over pleasure and fortune.

439
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,120
I don't understand! How can he rule such opposites!?

440
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:44,350
I've been told that those blessed by him with fortune and pleasure must pay the price while they're still of this world.

441
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,800
What...!?

442
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,280
Are you the leader of the goblins?

443
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,130
What's it to you?

444
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,790
I'm King Lewis.

445
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:11,170
I beg for your forgiveness, your highness! What brings you to this place where the sun doesn't shine?

446
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,700
I request a favor.

447
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,860
We'd do anything for a king! Just, there's always—

448
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,190
A price, I know. Here.

449
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,770
If that's not enough, I'll bring more.

450
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:31,660
You must have something mighty important you need done! Hahaha!

451
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:37,640
I need to you kidnap a baby... and kill them.

452
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,590
Before it's too late.

453
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,200
Ambassador of the Hero God!

454
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,270
Ambassador of the Spirit God!

455
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,670
Ambassador of the Dragon God!

456
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,320
Ambassador of the Ocean God!

457
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,240
All the God's disciples seem to be arriving now.

458
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,850
You could be seeing the ceremony in person, you know...

459
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:26,740
There's no need to worry about me...

460
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,900
Are you okay, my lady!?

461
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:42,540
I'm sorry. Julia... Do you think I'll be able to see my child's first birthday...?

462
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:52,560
What are you saying? Of course you will! You'll see him grow into a fine adult and even more beyond that.

463
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,740
I... would love that...

464
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,560
Right about now, the ambassadors should be presenting their gifts.

465
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,130
May the prince grow into a man beautiful in both body and heart.

466
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:22,110
May the prince grow into a valiant hero who won't give up in the face of any hardship.

467
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:28,710
May the prince grow into a wise man with both deep knowledge and insight.

468
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,430
What's going on!?

469
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,740
What, did you forget to invite me?

470
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,920
Ahh!

471
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:52,810
Not only did you fail to invite me, but you thought you could receive my kindness without paying the price.

472
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,690
Halt!

473
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,860
You won't lay a finger on him!

474
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:10,730
Hmm. I'm not here for the child. I'm here to collect on the king's debt.

475
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,370
W-what do you mean—

476
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:19,750
Don't play me for a fool! What was mine still resides on your finger.

477
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,160
Is this true, your highness!?

478
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:31,650
You underestimated me, boy. You made a promise, so now I'm here.

479
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:43,190
For the sin of trying to dishonor Gizafeal, this country will once again fall into misfortune!

480
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,140
Oh no!

481
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,940
AHH! AHHH!!!

482
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:54,040
And now, I will claim your most precious possession.

483
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,310
I've watched you closely to the very end, but I've decided.

484
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:04,280
I'll be taking "you" yourself!

485
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,960
HELP ME!!!

486
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,730
YOUR HIGHNESS!!!

487
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,450
HELP ME!!! AHHH!!!!!

488
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,950
HAHAHAHA!!!

489
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:23,070
You shall be mine for all eternity!!

490
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,390
-ABOVE! ABOVE! PROTECT HIS HIGHNESS AT ALL COSTS!!!
-YES, SIR!

491
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,460
Minister, please!

492
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,740
What!?

493
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:42,670
What has fallen into Gizafeal's hands is forever lost. But, we still have the gift from my protector, the Dragon God.

494
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,480
Which is?

495
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,400
It'll weaken Gizafeal's curse, if just a bit.

496
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:58,010
The prince will grow up and become the dawn upon this kingdom fallen to twilight.

497
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:04,420
Here and now, the Dragon God bestows upon the prince the name "Kai."

498
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,020
The king...!

499
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,900
They're searching the castle for him now!

500
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,460
How could this be...?

501
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,960
But, at least the prince is safe and was given the name Kai.

502
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,450
Kai...

503
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:45,330
Look, he's even got a pendant from the Dragon God as proof of the naming ceremony.

504
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,230
What was that sound?

505
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,250
I'm not sure...

506
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,030
There, that's the child! Take him away!

507
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,440
Stop it!

508
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
OUTTA THE WAY!

509
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,280
Julia!

510
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,520
HURRY IT UP!

511
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,010
Please stop! What are you doing with him!?

512
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,850
Kill him, of course! Hahaha!

513
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:14,000
Please, stop! Give Kai back to me! KAI!!!

514
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:33,420
Before long, the queen fell into despair after losing both her husband and child, and soon took her last breath.

515
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:40,080
Both the king and the prince have not been seen since.

516
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:56,350
Due to Gizafeal's curse, the country fell to waste. One by one, the people abandoned the castle as it fell to ruin.

517
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:09,190
Then, 17 years came and went.

518
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,770
Alright, I'm off, mom!

519
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,760
Are you really going off on a journey, Sarina?

520
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,190
Yeah. I'm off to find my own happiness.

521
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:26,860
Remember, don't tell anyone about your father. Especially any noblemen!

522
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:33,210
I know, I know. I hate those stuffy people, so I don't plan on talking to any either way.

523
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,970
Oh look, those two twin stars are back on the dawn's horizon again!

524
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,650
Back again?

525
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,100
They appeared once before on the day you were born.

526
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:49,900
Hmm. It must be a good sign then. Well, I'm off, mom!

527
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,360
Stay safe, Sarina.

528
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,000
I'll come back for sure, then we can live an easier life.

529
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:18,490
Hmm~ Should I take a slow journey this year, or laze around the forest some more? I can't decide~

530
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:30,370
Oh, I should see how the Pixian Forest is doing! Maybe not, I'm sure it's still in terrible shape... No, I should see it anyway!

531
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:54,160
Hey, Kai? Are we going to be stuck here mining until the day we die?

532
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,220
Don't lose hope, Michelia! I'm sure one day, we'll have our freedom.

533
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,600
How far away will that day be...?

534
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:11,270
I've actually been thinking of how to get away. I'll make sure we all escape from this slave camp, Michelia.

535
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,030
Really!?

536
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:19,410
Of course. And, I really want to know about my parents and homeland.

537
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,730
Kai, look! Something's glowing!

538
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,480
Woah, what is that?

539
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:35,960
I've never seen anything like this...

540
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,520
It gives me the creeps... We should throw it away.

541
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:46,390
Let's not. This feels like it could be the harbinger for what's to come.

542
00:46:52,970 --> 00:47:02,280
The curtain falls on one story, just as it rises on a new tale.

543
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,110
A tale of young warriors on a boundless adventure.

544
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:17,160
A new page now turns in the story of Ancient Roman.
